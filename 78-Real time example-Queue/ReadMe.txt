Real time example - Queue

When you walk into a bankor a passport office, you will collect a token and wait in the queue for your token number to be called.

From the application perspective, when a token is issued, the token number will be added to the end of the Queue.

When a representative at the counter is available to server a customer, he will push the "Next" button and the token number that is present at the beginning of the queue, will be dequeued.

So, this is one example, where a Queue collection class can be effectively used.
