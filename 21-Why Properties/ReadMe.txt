In this we use Getter and Setter Methods to read and write access to the fields.

But in C Sharp we don't use Getter and Setter Method instead of this we use  keywords "set", "get" and "value" keywords
to set the value and get the value. 

So you can see this set and get accessors in next code i.e. file (22 - Properties) refer this code for better understanding.
